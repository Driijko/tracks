  Another important musical influence comes from Chinese classical music, especially <a href="https://www.liufangmusic.net/English/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liu Fang</a>, <a href="https://www.actaonline.org/profile/weishan-liu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weishan Liu</a>, <a href="http://www.silkqin.com/03qobj/zengchengwei.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zeng Chenwei</a>, and <a href="https://www.auxsons.com/en/breves/sounds-of-the-world-guan-pinghu-the-spirit-of-chinese-guqin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guan Pinghu</a>. Chinese traditional and classical music is very diverse, but there are certain specific aesthetic ideals I find especially compelling: simplicity, contrast of timbre, and the use of space/silence as a kind of musical texture of it's own. You particularly see these ideals in music written for the qin.

  Visually, I was most inspired by the painters <a href="https://www.piet-mondrian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Piet Mondrian</a>, <a href="https://www.nga.gov/features/mark-rothko.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Rothko</a> and <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/3787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agnes Martin</a>. Each of these artists pursued a minimal abstract aesthetic motivated by a desire to capture a sense of immaterial transcendence. I made a website about Piet Mondrian a while back which charts his life and art which you can check out <a href="https://driijko.github.io/mondrian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

  If you're curious to hear other musical projects I've been a part of, you can check out an acoustic project I did a few years back <a href="https://asabovesobelowmusic.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nooperner noreferrer">here</a>. More recently I played synthesizer for a band called <span>nonono</span>, and ended up making a website for streaming our only album, <span>mood</span>, which you can check out <a href="https://driijko.github.io/nonono-mood" target="_blank" rel="nooperner noreferrer">here</a>.
