  My desire was to create a site which visually matched the music I was creating. Something dynamic, yet poised. My obsession is the idea of "flow": a mental state in which a person is completely immersed in an activity, undistracted. I often seek flow through cultivating a calm, relaxed atmosphere. The music and the website were designed to capture and cultivate a state of serene indulgence.

  Musically, I was most inspired by <a href="http://kaitlynaureliasmith.com/js_artist/kaitlyn-aurelia-smith/">Kaitlin Aurelia Smith</a>. Her album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/50y4wXsQ4K8Xi6YDOv7mGO?si=hJxKmX8RQCGXa5Flx9usJA">Euclid</a> in particular, which I think is an exceptional example of how to make electronic music sound organic.

  Another important musical influence comes from Chinese classical music, especially <a href="https://www.liufangmusic.net/English/">Liu Fang</a>, <a href="https://www.actaonline.org/profile/weishan-liu/">Weishan Liu</a>, <a href="http://www.silkqin.com/03qobj/zengchengwei.htm">Zeng Chenwei</a>, and <a href="https://www.auxsons.com/en/breves/sounds-of-the-world-guan-pinghu-the-spirit-of-chinese-guqin/">Guan Pinghu</a>. Chinese traditional and classical music is very diverse, but there are certain aesthetic ideals I find especially compelling: simplicity, contrast of timbre, and the use of space/silence as a kind of musical texture of it's own.

  Visually, I was most inspired by the painters <a href="https://www.piet-mondrian.org/">Piet Mondrian</a>, <a href="https://www.nga.gov/features/mark-rothko.html">Mark Rothko</a> and <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/3787">Agnes Martin</a>. Each of these artists pursued a minimal abstract aesthetic motivated by a desire to capture a sense of immaterial transcendence. I made a website about Piet Mondrian a while back which charts his life and art which you can check out <a href="https://driijko.github.io/mondrian">here</a>.

  If you're curious to hear other musical projects I've been a part of, you can check out an acoustic project I did a few years back <a href="https://asabovesobelowmusic.bandcamp.com/">here</a>. More recently I played synthesizer for a band called <span>nonono</span>, and ended up making a website for streaming our only album, <span>mood</span>, which you can check out <a href="https://driijko.github.io/nonono-mood">here</a>.
