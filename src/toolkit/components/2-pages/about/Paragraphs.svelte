  If you're curious to hear other musical projects I've been a part of, you can check out an acoustic project I did a few years back <a href="https://asabovesobelowmusic.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nooperner noreferrer">here</a>. More recently I played synthesizer for a band called <span>nonono</span>, and ended up making a website for streaming our only album, <span>mood</span>, which you can check out <a href="https://driijko.github.io/nonono-mood" target="_blank" rel="nooperner noreferrer">here</a>.
