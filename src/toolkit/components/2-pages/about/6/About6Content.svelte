  Visually, I was most inspired by the painters <a href="https://www.piet-mondrian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Piet Mondrian</a>, <a href="https://www.nga.gov/features/mark-rothko.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Rothko</a> and <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/3787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agnes Martin</a>.<br/><br class="portrait"/> Each of these artists pursued a minimal abstract aesthetic motivated by a desire to capture a sense of immaterial transcendence.<br class="portrait"/><br/> I made a website about Piet Mondrian a while back which charts his life and art which you can check out <a href="https://driijko.github.io/mondrian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
